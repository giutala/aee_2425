This university project forecasts solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation using solar irradiance and temperature data from the NSRDB. It employs machine learning models to predict energy output based on GHI, DNI, DHI, and temperature, while integrating explainable AI techniques for transparency and understanding key influencing factors.
